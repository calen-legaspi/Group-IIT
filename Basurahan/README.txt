Ignore the basurahan. 

Reminders. This is a Netbeans project.

Springsource Tools wont synchronize well when working on different sets of computers (or I was just too stupid to do the configurations).

//notes(i might forget some things):

-> create database configuration file for each machine accessing the project 
-> this file should not be added to the files tracked by git (as the contents have to be different for each machine)
